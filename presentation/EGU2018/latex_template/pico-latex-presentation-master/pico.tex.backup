\justifying
On 3 February 2015 five avalanches were artificially released at the Valle\'e de
la Sionne test site in the west of Switzerland. The dense parts of the
avalanches were tracked by the GEODAR Mark 2 radar system at \SI{111}{\hertz}
framerate with \SI{0.75}{\metre} down slope resolution.

\vspace{0.2cm}
The data show that these avalanches contain several internal surges and
that the avalanche front is repeatedly overtaken by some of these surges. We
show that these surges exist on different scales. While the major surges
originate
from secondary triggered slab releases and occur all over the avalanche, the
minor surges are only found in the energetic part of a well developed powder
snow avalanche. The mass of the major surges can be as huge as the initial
released mass, this has a dramatic effect on the mass distribution inside the
avalanche and effects the front velocity and run out. Furthermore, the secondary
released snow slabs are an important entrainment mechanism and up to
\SI{50}{\percent} of the mass entered the avalanche via slab entrainment.

\vspace{0.2cm}
We analyse the dynamics of the leading edge and the minor surges in more detail
using a simple one dimensional model with frictional resistance and quadratic
velocity dependent drag. These models fit the data well for the start and middle
of avalanche but cannot capture the slowing and overtaking of the minor surges.
We find much higher friction coefficients are needed to describe the surging. We propose
that this data can only be explained by changes in the snow surface. These
effects are not included in current models yet, but the data presented here will
enable the development and verification of such models.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}\label{\secvariable}
  
  \begin{itemize}
   \item GEODAR radar is able to track internal surges (flow height waves)
below the powder cloud of snow avalanches.
   Two types of surges exist: \textit{Major} and \textit{Minor surges} are
differentiated by their length.
  \item Major surges can occur at random location in the flow and influence the
mass distribution of the avalanche.
   Minor surges are ubiquitous feature of the fast--flowing energetic
part in the frontal region of large powder avalanches. 
  \item The effective friction between the front and the avalanche body
differs. This must be explained with changes in the snow surface like smoothing
and entrainment of the soft, upper snow layers. Numerical models not yet account for this.
